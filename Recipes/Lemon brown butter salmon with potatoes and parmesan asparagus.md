2. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Add the salmon to the center of the pan (if the salmon is large, cut it into smaller portions). Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil and the cajun seasoning. Add the asparagus to the pan and toss with the parmesan. Bake everything together for 10-15 minutes or until the salmon has reached your desired doneness.
3. SALAD: In a bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add the arugula, basil, dill, and a pinch of chili flakes. Toss to combine. 
4. Add the butter to a medium pot set over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown, until it smells toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Stir often. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon lemon juice.
