* 1 pound sweet potatoes, diced into 1/2-inch cubes (also peeled, if desired)
* 1 tablespoon 
* <u>[avocado oil](https://amzn.to/3c4XSRK)</u> (or olive oil)
* 2 teaspoons 
* <u>[taco seasoning](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-taco-seasoning-recipe-taco-seasoning-mix/)</u> (homemade or store-bought)

* <u>[corn tortillas](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-corn-tortillas/)</u> or <u>[flour tortillas](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/flour-tortillas/)</u>1 avocado, peeled, pitted and thinly sliced

## Instructions
* Make the roasted sweet potatoes. Heat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  
* In a large mixing bowl, toss the sweet potatoes with the oil, taco seasoning, and a pinch of salt and black pepper until combined.  Spread the potatoes out on the prepared baking sheet in an even layer.  Bake for 25-35 minutes — flipping once halfway through, until the potatoes are tender and cooked through.
* Make the refried beans. 

Lime crema instructions: Whisk together 1 cup sour cream (or plain Greek yogurt), juice of 1 lime, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and a pinch of salt.
