## **Directions**
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
### **To prepare vegetables and rice:** 
* In a medium bowl, whisk 1/2 cup rice vinegar, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt, until sugar is dissolved. Add the cucumber and carrot and toss to coat. Set aside.
* Place rice in fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water, gently agitating with hands until liquid runs clear. Bring rice and 2 1/2 cups cold water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook until water evaporates and rice is tender, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes.
* Whisk remaining 1/4 cup vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Sprinkle the mixture over the rice and gently fold it into rice. Cover and let sit until ready to use.
### **To prepare the salmon:** 
* In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce and honey. Place salmon on prepared baking sheet and brush tops and sides with soy sauce mixture. Bake for 5 minutes. Brush salmon again with the soy sauce mixture and continue to bake for another 5 to 8 minutes, until salmon reaches desired doneness. Discard remaining soy sauce mixture.
**To assemble:** 
* Drain cucumber and carrot pickles.
* Divide sushi rice among 4 serving bowls. Top each with salmon, pickled vegetables, edamame and avocado. Garnish with nori strips and sesame seeds
