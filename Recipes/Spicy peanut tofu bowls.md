## Start rice first!

TOFU:
* 2 blocks of extra firm tofu
* 1–2 tablespoons cornstarch
* olive oil and salt
* 2 small (or 1 large) head of broccoli, cut into florets
* 2 red bell peppers, cut into strips
* 1 1/2 cups uncooked rice

PEANUT SAUCE (edited 4/6/22 to 1.5x the sauce 😋)
- [x] a large clove of fresh garlic, peeled
- [x] a smallish knob of fresh ginger, peeled
- [x] 3 tablespoons sugar, honey, or agave
- [x] 2 tablespoons sambal oelek or chili paste (2 is good for Alicia normally, 1 with heartburn)
- [x] 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- [x] 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
- [x] 3 tablespoons sesame oil (toasted or dark)
- [x] 3/4 cup peanut butter

INSTRUCTIONS
* Press liquid out of the tofu. Cube tofu and toss (gently) with the cornstarch until coated.
*  Arrange on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Arrange broccoli and peppers on another baking sheet. Drizzle all with olive oil and salt. 
* Roast both pans at 425 degrees for 20-30 minutes, until tofu is slightly crisped and broccoli is roasty and delicious.
* While the tofu and broccoli are roasting, cook the rice.
* Also, make the sauce by blending everything in a blender or food processor.
* Serve tofu and broccoli with rice and a good drizzle of peanut sauce.
