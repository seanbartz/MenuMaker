INSTRUCTIONS
* Press liquid out of the tofu. Cube tofu and toss (gently) with the cornstarch until coated.
*  Arrange on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Arrange broccoli and peppers on another baking sheet. Drizzle all with olive oil and salt. 
* Roast both pans at 425 degrees for 20-30 minutes, until tofu is slightly crisped and broccoli is roasty and delicious.
* While the tofu and broccoli are roasting, cook the rice.
* Also, make the sauce by blending everything in a blender or food processor.
* Serve tofu and broccoli with rice and a good drizzle of peanut sauce.
