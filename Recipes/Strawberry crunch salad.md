**INGREDIENTS**
SALAD
* ⅔ cup sliced or slivered almonds
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 10 ounces arugula greens
* 8 ounces strawberries, hulled and quartered or chopped
* 1 avocado chopped
* 2 ounces crumbled goat cheese,
* ⅓ cup roasted salted pistachios, chopped
CHAMPAGNE VINAIGRETTE
* 3 tablespoons champagne vinegar
* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
* 1 garlic clove, freshly grated
* pinch kosher salt and pepper
* 1/2 cup olive oil

INSTRUCTIONS 
* Place the almonds in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and cook, stirring often, until the sugar melts and is caramely, coating all of the almonds - about 6 to 8 minutes. Don’t take your eyes off of this as they can burn quickly! Transfer the almonds to a piece of parchment paper to let them cool. Break them into pieces if they are clumped.
* Combine vinegar, honey, lemon juice, dijon, garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl and whisk together. Stream in the olive oil while constantly whisking until the dressing comes together. Store in the fridge for up to one week.
