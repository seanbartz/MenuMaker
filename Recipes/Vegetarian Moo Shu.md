MOO SHU INGREDIENTS:
* 1 batch crispy tofu (see below)
* 1 batch sauce (see below)
* 2 tablespoons peanut oil (or olive oil)
* 2 large eggs, whisked
* 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
* 1 (14-ounce) bag coleslaw*
* 1/2 cup thinly-sliced green onions
* for serving: flour tortillas, lettuce cups, rice or quinoa
* toppings: hoisin sauce, extra green onions, toasted sesame seeds
CRISPY TOFU INGREDIENTS:
* 14 ounces extra-firm tofu
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 tablespoon peanut oil (or olive oil)
SAUCE INGREDIENTS:
* 1/2 cup hoisin sauce1/4 cup 
* rice vinegar2 tablespoons 
* oyster sauce2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon 
* toasted sesame oil1/4 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper
TO MAKE THE MOO SHU:
* Prepare the crispy tofu (if using) and sauce.  See instructions below.
* Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large non-stick sauté pan over medium heat.  Add the whisked eggs and let then cooked undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until they are mostly set and form an omelet.  Flip the omelet and cook for 1 more minute on the second side.  Then transfer the omelet to a separate 
* cutting board, and roughly chop it into small, thin pieces.  Set aside.
* Return the pan to the stove, and increase heat to high heat.  Add 1 more tablespoon of oil and heat until shimmering.  Then add the mushrooms and sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked and lightly browned.  Add the coleslaw and half of the scallions.  Saute for 2-3 minutes more, or until the cabbage has softened to your liking.
* Add in the cooked tofu, 2/3 of the sauce, half of the green onions.  Toss until combined.
* Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed.
* Serve over flour tortillas, lettuce cups, rice, or quinoa.  Drizzle with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle with your desired garnishes.  Then serve warm and enjoy!

TO MAKE THE CRISPY TOFU:
* Slice your block of tofu into 1/4-inch-thick slabs.  Lay some paper towels or a clean tea towel on a large flat surface, like a cutting board, and lay the slabs in a single layer on top of the paper towels.  Cover with another layer of paper towels.  Then place a second cutting board on top of the tofu, and stack a bunch of heavy cans or pots or whatever you can safely balance on top of the cutting board.  The idea is to put a lot of pressure/weight on the tofu, which will help the excess water to press out into the paper towels.  Let the tofu drain for at least 15-30 minutes.
* Once the tofu is ready to go, slice it into your desired shapes.  (I made thin strips, which you can see in the photos above.)  Add the tofu to a large mixing bowl, sprinkle it evenly with the cornstarch, salt and pepper.  Then toss until the tofu is evenly coated in the cornstarch mixture.
* Heat oil in a large non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the tofu and arrange it in a single layer.  (You may need to do this in two batches if your pan isn’t large enough for the tofu to all fit in a single layer.)  Cook the tofu undisturbed until it is browned on the bottom side, about 2 minutes.  Flip the tofu and cook until the second side is browned, about 1-2 minutes.  Give the whole mixture a gentle toss and cook for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is browned to your liking.
* Transfer the tofu to a clean plate and set aside until ready to use.
TO MAKE THE SAUCE:
* Whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl until combined.
