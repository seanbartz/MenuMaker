Add the noodles and cook for 1-2 minutes (they should NOT be all the way cooked \u2013 just enough to barely soften). Drain and rinse with cold water \u2013 this removes starch and helps them stir fry without turning into a big blob. Set aside.\n* Place all the sauce ingredients in the food processor and give it a whirl. When it\u2019s smooth, taste it and adjust to your liking. Cut the tofu into slices and press out the excess moisture several times with paper towels. Cut the tofu slices into cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large wok or nonstick skillet. When the oil is shiny, add the tofu. Stir fry very gently (breaks apart easily) for 5-10 minutes until deep golden brown. Add a tiny splash of black pepper sauce, a tiny splash of water, and 1/2 tablespoon oil and shake the pan around \u2013 everything will be all sizzly and awesome. When the tofu is cooked to your liking, transfer to a bowl and set aside.\n* Heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in the skillet. When the oil is shiny, add the noodles and black pepper sauce. Add a splash of water if the sauce becomes too thick. Stir fry until the noodles are softened completely, covered with sauce, and piping hot. Remove from heat and toss with the spinach and tofu. Serve sprinkled with sesame seeds.\n"

Toss with oil and set aside.\n\nPan fry the chicken: Coat each chicken breast in flour mixture; shake off excess. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the butter after the oil heats up to prevent burning it. Add chicken pieces and cook for a few minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken and keep warm.\n\nMake the sauce:\u00a0Add your cherry tomatoes into the chicken pan \u2013 leaving all the oil and extra browned bits so the tomatoes can pick up all that flavor. Cook the tomatoes until they are soft and burst under the gentle pressure of the back of a wooden spoon. Break the tomatoes to release their juices and make a thick sauce.\n\nAdd the veggies: Add the corn and zucchini; saut\u00e9 for a few minutes until the zucchini is softened. Stir in the garlic for your last minute of saut\u00e9ing, just long enough to make your kitchen smell amazing. Add lemon juice, cream, and season with salt and pepper.\n\nPut it together: Add pasta and toss gently to bring it all together. Serve topped with Parmesan, basil, and a nice piece of golden brown chicken."
